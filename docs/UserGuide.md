# Data Management
<hr />

## Storage

The data files are stored at _"./RecipeData"_ directory.

The template file and other miscellaneous files are stored at _"./RecipeData/App"_ directory.

The recipe data files are stored at _"./RecipeData/Recipes"_ directory.

There are 2 types of recipe data files to store recipes:
- **Overall File (OF)**: Keeps track of the recipe titles. User can open this file to have a birds-eye-view
at all the recipes that is currently in the recipe list.
- **Individual Recipe File (IRF)**: The details of each recipe is saved as an individual file that is named
after the recipe title. User can open the individual recipe file to look at the full details of the recipe.

### Saving The Data
There is no need to save manually. Any updates made to the data will be automatically 
stored into the local drive and reloaded when _RecipEditor_ is restarted.

### Editing Data File

- After `/add`
    - New IRF (whose file name is named after the Recipe Title) is saved
    - New Recipe Title is appended to OF
- After `/edit INDEX`
    - Update existing IRF at INDEX
    - Update OF (change Title)
- After `/delete RECIPE_TITLE`
    - Delete existing IRF
    - Update OF by removing the Recipe Title of the recipe being deleted

### Parsing Data File

- If user tempered with the data files, these are the potential problems encountered when the program starts and reads
  the data
    - Mismatch between IRF Title and OF Title
        - Delete IRF
    - IRF content cannot be parsed
        - Delete IRF
- New OF File is generated from the model contains the valid recipes loaded from IRFs
