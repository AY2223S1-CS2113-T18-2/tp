## Overview
RecipEditor is a hybrid CLI-GUI application that allows you to manage your recipes with the speed 
and convenience of command-line based tools. It helps users to store recipes, edit saved recipes, 
delete unused or outdated recipes, find recipes with relevant keywords, view and list recipes.
